PokeChat functions as a modernized AI-powered version of the Pokedex, that serves as a virtual assistant with all the knowledge of Pokémon. The chatbot uses the [Pokémon API](https://pokeapi.co/) to provide detailed information about various Pokémon. It functions as a modernized version of the Pokedex, but with added features like memory management and the ability to compare multiple Pokémon at once.
